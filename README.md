# About
Wally’s Service Garage is a new service garage that services all kinds of cars and light trucks. The shop has plans for 30 service bays
and almost as many mechanics to staff them. However, scheduling which vehicles go where and when they go is no small task. That
is the primary job of the service manager.

Wally’s offers special paid “tier” plans whereby customers can get quicker service on their vehicles. There are three tiers: Silver,
Gold, and Platinum. Platinum tier vehicles get the fastest service, followed by Gold, and then by Silver. Vehicles with no tier plans get
the slowest service. So theoretically, all Platinum plan vehicles are serviced before all Gold plan vehicles; all Gold plan vehicles are
serviced before all Silver plan vehicles; all Silver plan vehicles are serviced before all vehicles with no plan. The only exception to this
is for hybrid or electric vehicles, which may be serviced before others according to the restrictions on some service bays.

Your company is bidding on contract to build software to help the service manager schedule and manage the repair waiting lot and
the service bays. To sweeten your company’s bid, your boss has asked you to create a simple prototype to illustrate how the software
might work. The prototype must support the current operational procedures and restrictions.
